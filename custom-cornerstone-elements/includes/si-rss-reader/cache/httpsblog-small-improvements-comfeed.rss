<p>One of those pesky UI/UX flaws had to do with the “editable until” field for performance reviews within Small Improvements, and how its relationship to the “sign by” field. The problem appeared when admins would set an earlier date for edits than for the signature.</p>
<p>When the “editable until” deadline passed, the review would lock, meaning it was impossible for both manager and reviewee to sign the review.</p>

<p>We needed to take action. So we made some tweaks and <strong>now it’s possible for both the manager and reviewee to sign off on a review, even after it&#8217;s been locked down</strong>.</p>
<p>We understood more flexibility and clarity was needed here, and appreciate everyone who provided feedback.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.small-improvements.com&#038;blog=32719928&#038;post=4916&#038;subd=smallimprove&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fluid nature of modern work environments means we sometimes find ourselves outside of traditional team structures, working in flat hierarchies or lending our skill sets to ad-hoc projects.</p>
<p><span class="inline-comment-marker valid">We have a host of features supporting feedback reviews from anyone to anyone, but the performance review is still generally between one employee and their direct manager. The secondary reviewer concept allows admins to add a second person to contribute to a manager review, thereby making it a more complete review. </span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been wanting to improve our current secondary review feature for a while &#8211; in particular, to incorporate feedback from some of our customers. While a full overhaul is still planned, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve tweaked to enhance your experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We increased visibility for the administrator</strong><strong>.</strong> Admins now have a clear overview of who within the organization is participating as secondary reviewers.</li>
<li><strong>We increased visibility for the secondary reviewer</strong><strong>.</strong> In the past, the secondary reviewer had to implicitly know that a review was happening, i.e., we didn’t notify them of their status. Now, the secondary reviewer receives both an action item and an email &#8211; at the start of a cycle as well as during (in the form of a nudge).</li>
<li><strong>Notification for the manager.</strong> A hint at the top of the review screen will inform managers that a secondary reviewer is also participating.</li>
</ul>

<p>As before, HR admins are capable of assigning their employees one secondary reviewer. This person can then add their feedback during a review cycle, but will not be able to sign off on the review or share it. This can only be done by the manager.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>We wanted to relaunch this feature without making any dramatic changes within the software. So secondary reviewers need to add their notes in the same field as the manager, and can differentiate themselves by tagging themselves within the form or by writing their initials next to their input.</p>

<p>While secondary reviewers will not have access to past performance reviews, they will see objectives and messages that the reviewee has shared with them in the resources panel, as well as any private notes or 360 feedback they&#8217;ve written about the reviewee.</p>
<p>Secondary reviewers can also make adjustments to the <span class="inline-comment-marker valid">assessment graph</span>, but the final signoff and share is limited to the manager.</p>

<p>Over the course of 2016, we traversed the USA and Europe to moderate our “Helping Managers” <a href="https://help.small-improvements.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000027949-Series-Helping-Managers-Become-Better-Managers">panel discussions in five different cities</a>. One commonality we noticed among our panelists was how strongly they advocated for regular check-ins, or 1:1s, with their employees. These open, honest conversations have proven to be beneficial for both parties, but for managers they’re particularly advantageous because they help identify problems early within a team.</p>
<p>There’s a clear difference, however, between simply scheduling regular 1:1s and building a culture of successful 1:1s within your team or organization. So how can you revamp individual meetings within your own company? Below are the five key approaches that top HR leaders recommend.</p>
<p><strong><span id="more-4810"></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Make Them Frequent</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcatterfeld/de">John Catterfeld</a>, head of software engineering at OpenTable UK, aims for 1:1s with his direct reports on a bi-weekly basis.</p>
<p>“Doing them frequently creates a relaxed atmosphere so you don’t dread it when they come up once every six weeks,” he said during our <a href="https://help.small-improvements.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000162629-London-Penguin-Random-House-UK-OpenTable-UK-and-Salmon">Speaker Series in London</a>. “They become a regular part of every two-week sprint instead.”</p>
<p>While regular 1:1s should be the goal, but the frequency is dependent on the needs of individual organizations. Here at Small Improvements we aim for weekly 1:1s, which we find optimal given our size and hierarchy setup. But bi-weekly or even monthly 1:1s are also beneficial.</p>
<p>“It’s an individualistic thing based on the team member and manager, and you should find your own cadence,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-wilks-4293271/de">Neil Wilks</a>, SoundCloud’s Director of People Partnerships.</p>
<p>The critical point &#8211; familiarity breeds comfort, which means employees will be more willing to speak openly if 1:1s are not promoted as rare events.</p>
<p><strong>Make Them Personal</strong></p>
<p>Our panelists believe that effective 1:1s should have a high-level focus on the employee and their needs, and not be used to discuss actionable tasks or the next week’s agenda.</p>
<p>“If you get straight into ‘where are you on this project’, the tone of the conversation is set up to be transactional,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morrisonneil/de">Neil Morrison</a>, the Director of Strategy, Culture and Innovation at Penguin Random House in the UK. “Whereas, if you start with a ‘how are ya’, ‘what are you up to’ &#8211; some of the things that come out can be really useful.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joris-luijke-1692754?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=rW4x&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=368975291487670227394&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=2&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A368975291487670227394%2CVSRPtargetId%3A12595617%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH">Joris Luijke</a>, People Chief at Grovo, shared the same sentiment at our New York panel.</p>
<p>“1:1s are not about providing coaching all the time,”Luijke said. “It’s about checking in where a person’s sitting emotionally, if they had any frustrations or wins in the last week.”</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to connect on a personal level with your employee, Catterfeld suggested occasionally shifting the conversation towards personal development. But an effective manager knows that check-ins at the personal level provide them not only with a better understanding of their employee, but gives them insight into what might be affecting their workplace behavior and decision-making.</p>

<p>Disqus helps its managers by providing them with a toolkit, which includes a document guiding them through 1:1s. The document alone has already garnered somewhat of a reputation among the HR community in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;We have a basic 1:1 format: what’s going well, what are you struggling with and how can I help you,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimrohrer">Kim Rohrer</a>, Disqus&#8217; VP of People and Culture. &#8220;I find it’s important to have an open space to talk about your challenges in a safe way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Make Them Interactive</strong></p>
<p>Our panelists agree that the ideal 1:1 should not be dominated by one party. Give your employees the space and freedom to discuss what’s on their mind, but be an open book yourself as well.</p>
<p>“If the conversation isn’t particularly flowing, I’ll throw out some problems I’m having, ‘hey can you help me with this’,” Catterfeld said. “Just to build that trust and the feeling that you can have a chat with your manager about anything you want.”</p>
<p>It’s normal to hit a communication hiccup from time to time. Wilks admitted he sometimes blanked when holding 1:1s with his boss, simply because he ran out of things to talk about. This happens, it’s normal. But it’s advantageous for the other end of the 1:1 to read these cues and help move the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Make Them Sacred</strong></p>
<p>Once you and an employee agree on the time for your 1:1, set it in stone. LifeLabs leadership consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taniadluna/de">Tania Luna</a> noted the biggest frustrations she hears from managers is when their direct reports cancel meetings.</p>
<p>If you make the 1:1 a fixed part of your team’s routine, and hold to it no matter how intense the workload is, then an employee will naturally begin to take them more seriously. Once both parties have bought into the to 1:1, the real coaching can begin.</p>

<p>“The thing we’ve seen make an impact is a perspective shift on that 1:1 being an opportunity to check on work progress,” Luna said <a href="https://help.small-improvements.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000139669-New-York-SoundCloud-Grovo-LifeLabs-Learning-and-Recruiting-Inferno">during our New York panel</a>, “into shifting that time to ‘this is our sacred time, and no matter how crazy things get, you know you’ll have my undivided attention during this time.’”</p>
<p>The sentiment was echoed <a href="https://help.small-improvements.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000133665-San-Francisco-Pinterest-Reddit-and-Disqus">from across the country in San Francisco</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/micaela-mcdonald-b91647a7/de">Micaela McDonald</a>, who is People Manager at Pinterest, makes herself available every week for 1:1s. By blocking off time, no matter how hectic her schedule, for 1:1s, McDonald shows her managers and reports that she values their time, input and feedback.</p>
<p>“To dedicate 30 minutes to an hour to someone every week and to give them your attention and just listen to what they have to say, it’s just really, really crucial,” McDonald said.</p>
<p><strong>Make Them Flexible</strong></p>
<p>While the 1:1 facilitates a two-way dialogue between both parties, several of our speakers felt their 1:1 culture took off when the employees began taking the lead on the meetings. Ovia Health, a women’s health company in Boston, has their employees plan the agenda for the 1:1s beforehand.</p>
<p>“We’ve put together a 1:1 worksheet, but we also ensure that it’s not a checklist on activities,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mollyehoward/de">Molly Howard</a>, Ovia Health’s People Operations Manager. “It should be focused on that person’s professional development and long-term goals, instead of ‘I’ve got this task and I don’t know how to accomplish it.’”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katelinholloway/de">Katelin Holloway</a>, VP of Culture and People at Reddit, puts the responsibility of the 1:1 on the direct report. She asks employees beforehand to send her an email outlining where they need help, what roadblocks they’re experiencing and to list their successes. This gives each meeting a clear structure, and ensures the employee maximizes the value of the 1:1.</p>
<p>“It allows the employee to guide the conversation in the way that they want,” Holloway said.</p>
<p><em>It’s important to remember that no 1:1 format is perfect. <em>What works for one might not find traction in another team, let alone in another company</em>. Perhaps there’s a strategy that’s worked well for you. If so, we’d love to hear more about it, either in the comments or on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/smallimprove">@Smallimprove</a>).</em></p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.small-improvements.com&#038;blog=32719928&#038;post=4810&#038;subd=smallimprove&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>We love how it highlights even small events that don’t trigger an email or Slack notification, such as “Someone liked the praise you sent.” That’s not only gratifying, but it encourages further positive feedback.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small tweak, but it has an impact &#8211; we’ve been testing it within our own Small Improvements&#8217; account and have seen a clear boost in engagement. We&#8217;re betting you&#8217;ll notice a difference, too.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.small-improvements.com&#038;blog=32719928&#038;post=4732&#038;subd=smallimprove&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>At our London panel discussion in December, we sat down with:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Neil Morrison, Director of Strategy, Culture and Innovation at </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.co.uk/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Penguin Random House UK</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Jess Critchlow, Learning &amp; Development Manager at </span><a href="https://salmon.com/en/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Salmon</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">John Catterfeld, Head of Software Engineering at </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="https://www.opentable.co.uk/start/home">OpenTable UK</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We’ve attached a video of the event below, but here’s a quick recap of the highlights:</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4699"></span></p>
<h2><b>On what it actually means to be a great manager</b><span style="font-weight:400;">:</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the most important skills of a manager is the ability to draw out potential issues and mitigate them early on. That means l</span>istening to the quieter voices, not just the people who tend to dominate the conversation. “We assume people will speak up if they’ve got something to say, and therefore if they don’t, they’ve got nothing to say,” Neil said. “<strong>Rather, we should be asking: what’s on your mind?</strong>”</p>
<p><b></b>In addition, it&#8217;s important to be patient and not jump straight into &#8220;fix-it&#8221; mode. “So often with managers you go into solving straightaway &#8211; how do I give you the answer, how do I solve,” Neil said. “I think the ability <strong>to be curious, to ask questions, to try and seek to understand before you get to the problem solving</strong> is one of the things that separates good from average.”</p>
<p><b></b>Jess recommends an approach that emphasizes <strong>courage and empathy</strong>. “The managers that really makes a difference in both the organization and in their team members’ lives are the ones who have the hard conversations,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They push for things that are against the grain but they do it with empathy. So instead of ‘can you stop waving your hands around because you look stupid’ &#8211; it’s ‘you don’t look intelligent when you do that and I know you are intelligent, so I want to work with you on how you can come across in a different way.’”</p>
<p>John believes that when it comes to <strong>fostering open and honest communication</strong>, 1:1s are an invaluable forum. “Finding out what people are struggling with is really important,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Giving them the opportunity to speak to me, and trusting that when I speak to them, I’m giving them all the information that I can and that I’m not holding anything back.”</p>
<h2><b>On how companies can encourage good management</b><span style="font-weight:400;">:</span></h2>
<p>From a lack of development to establishing the wrong KPIs, our panelists discussed how organizations can inadvertently inhibit managers, and offered solutions on what HR can do to encourage good management. It starts with <strong>setting the right responsibilities and KPIs. </strong><span style="font-weight:400;">Basing performance solely on project-based tasks can set the wrong incentives for leaders, so organizations must establish management-related responsibilities and KPIs to encourage and keep managers on track.</span></p>
<p>Another challenge can be an abrupt change in team structure. Often managers gain their roles by moving up in an organization’s ranks. “The help that I received is <strong>more gradual transition</strong>,” John said, referring to his own path from an engineer to the Head of Engineering. “Instead of throwing managers into the deep end from day one, give them more responsibilities over time. Any way you can transition parts of the role of being a manager is worth investigating.”</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>invest in developing communication skills</strong>. At Penguin Random House UK, different levels of training are offered for different levels of managers as they progress through their careers. “One of the themes is around coaching conversations,” Neil said. “Whether it’s informally or formally &#8211; the ability to ask good questions, to use insightful language and to be able to try and identify problems is crucial.”</p>
<h2><b>On how to encourage feedback culture</b><span style="font-weight:400;">: </span></h2>
<p>Whether or not employees feel comfortable giving and receiving feedback is largely dependent on their surrounding culture. So how can managers help foster a feedback-focused environment?</p>
<p>Start by <strong>bringing it back to a human level</strong>. <span style="font-weight:400;">“It’s not just about knowing they want to be a business analyst one day; it’s I know they prefer weak tea, and I should get them one because I know they’re stressed,” Jess said. &#8220;We forget and make it this over-engineered thing. But sometimes, it is the small things that make the biggest difference.” </span></p>
<p>“By being honest about what’s going on in your life and asking about theirs; remembering their answers and wanting to know your people as people &#8211; it builds a culture of trust and makes people become comfortable in their workplace,” John added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important for managers to<b> reward the behavior you want to encourage. </b>“What we sometimes do as managers is we say ‘we’re all in this together’, but what I really want is for you to get work done and not bother me with things. And I’ll reward you for being quiet instead of giving me feedback,” Jess said. “If we say we want our direct reports to ask for what they need and tell us what they think, then we also have to reward that behavior rather than unconsciously punishing it.”</p>
<h2><b>On what managers can do to improve on a daily basis</b><span style="font-weight:400;">:</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Try to </span><b>make time to just hang out</b><span style="font-weight:400;">,” Neil said. “Eating and drinking with people can be really powerful, particularly for building relationships. Whether it’s a glass of wine after work or lunch, the connection that comes through breaking bread and sharing with people is quite powerful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">John recommends for managers to be conscious of the </span><b>manager vs. maker schedule</b><span style="font-weight:400;">. “If you are a manager, your schedule is filled with meetings and you squeeze one in whenever you find time. But for the maker &#8211; someone like a software engineer, they need big chunks of free time to really get something done,” he explains. “So always try to schedule meetings with such employees first thing, just before or after lunch to accommodate their schedule.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Jess highlights that often managers think because they get paid more, it’s solely up to them to figure out problems. “That’s not true,” she said. “Hopefully you have an HR team, or a manager or even a peer who you can bounce ideas off of. But </span><b>you have to ask for what you need</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8211; whether it’s space or if you need someone to stop booking meetings for you at 3pm, you just need to do it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We all know feedback is good for us. Effective feedback, both positive and negative, can help employees keep track of performance, feel more involved in the workplace and enhance employee engagement. Yet </span><a href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/182792/managers-account-variance-employee-engagement.aspx"><span style="font-weight:400;">Gallup</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> reports that, only </span><b>13% of worldwide employees are engaged at work</b><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<h2><strong>So how can we leverage feedback to foster better communication and engagement?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Jason Lauritsen explains that most feedback processes fail due to a disconnect in how businesses and employees view the employment relationship. Employees nowadays don’t view work as a contract where compensation is exchanged for manual labor. Instead, they </span><b>experience work as a relationship</b><span style="font-weight:400;">. Most approaches to performance management are traditionally designed with a “contract fulfillment” mindset &#8211; often at the expense of the relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Join Jason as he explores how we can </span><b>modify feedback processes by designing them to foster healthy relationships</b><span style="font-weight:400;">. His “relationship test” will illustrate how traditional feedback approaches have been damaging rather than building relationships, and help us better understand how we can make performance management more human-friendly.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Choosing the right managers is one of the most critical decisions an organization makes. </span><b>But what makes someone a great manager?</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> While a lot of research have identified qualitative traits of great managers and the different ways they contribute to business success &#8211; there is still a lack in understanding of what great managers actually </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> on a daily basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our most recent panel in the Helping Managers Become Better Managers </span><a href="https://help.small-improvements.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000027949-Series-Helping-Managers-Become-Better-Managers"><span style="font-weight:400;">series</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> was held in Berlin. We welcomed expert speakers from </span><b><a href="http://trainer-akademie.de/">TAM Trainer Akademie</a></b><span style="font-weight:400;"> (Lorenz Illing, MD), </span><b><a href="https://marleyspoon.de/">Marley Spoon</a></b><span style="font-weight:400;"> (Cindy Rubbens, Head of Culture &amp; People Operations) and </span><b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a></b><span style="font-weight:400;"> (Jennifer Beecher, Learning &amp; Development) to discuss the importance of managers in organizations. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Below we’ve summarized a few key takeaways: </span></p>
<h1><b>What behaviors do great managers exhibit?</b></h1>

<p><span id="more-4597"></span></p>
<h2><b>They don’t “manage,” they facilitate</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“We have a reverse pyramid at Marley Spoon,” said Cindy. “It’s the manager who </span><b>enables and makes sure everyone else can do their job</b><span style="font-weight:400;">. The manager is working for the employees, not the other way around.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Lorenz seconds the notion that managers must facilitate purpose within their team. “Serve is the number one attitude you should have as a manager. The manager has more context, information and POV than the rest of the team, which is why you have to empower your employees and give them every resource they need, so they can do what they are paid for.” </span></p>
<h2><b>They self-reflect</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When it came to identifying what makes someone a good manager, Jennifer chose self-reflection. “The higher up you are, the more influence you have. And the more you’re an amplifier, the more you yourself need to be able to adjust to the people around you,” she explained. “If you can’t reflect on what your strengths and gaps are, then you can’t grow. Only if I know the values I project onto other people, the biases that I have, and can communicate them clearly and manage dealing with them &#8211; only then can I really be effective in handling group dynamics with several people involved.”</span></p>
<h2><b>They give AND receive honest feedback</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In order to communicate successfully, managers must build relationships that create trust, open dialogue and transparency. “You have to learn to open up to others to receive opening up from others; in a very respectful way, but also a very real way,” Lorenz said. “And you always have to make the first step. It’s your responsibility to make others know that you are an honest person with no agenda.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Being able to have difficult conversations is also important. “I try to frame the conversation by saying this is not a personal conversation, it’s a business one, and this is how I will behave afterwards.” Jennifer shared her own personal approach. “Be explicit about how difficult their own reaction to feedback will be and give them time to deal with it.”  </span></p>
<h1 style="text-align:left;"><b>What are some actionable ways to help managers succeed?</b></h1>

<h2><b>Set clear expectations</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“We create our processes together with the management team, train managers to do the processes and then we let them free,” Cindy shared. “Our role is to make them successful, make sure they are owning the KPIs of retention, and not HR.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Enable managers by setting clear expectations of what the management role means,” said Jennifer. “</span><b>You can’t fulfill the expectations if you don’t know them</b><span style="font-weight:400;">.“</span></p>
<h2><b>Regular one-on-ones </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">At Marley Spoon, every single person has a one-on-one at least once a month. “It’s all about the person &#8211; how are you, what is happening in your office, how are you coping with the environment at Marley Spoon, etc.” Cindy explains. “We believe if we </span><b>build trust </b><span style="font-weight:400;">and get to know each other, then we can </span><b>find conflicts and solutions early</b><span style="font-weight:400;">.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Provide extra support</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Being a manager is not an easy task, and regular training sessions can keep managers at their best. Lorenz highlighted the ability to be a moderator as an important skill many managers need additional training on. “Very often as a manager you’re directly in that position,” Lorenz said. “There are different kind of groups with different ideas, but </span><b>as a manager you are not the opinion leader, you’re the moderator of the situation</b><span style="font-weight:400;">. You have to be able to ask the right questions and put your opinions out of the room. This is a technique that you have to learn.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“We also believe that there’s a lot of knowledge already from within,” Cindy added. “So we have our leadership academy, and that is for everyone who is leading or managing people, even just one person. And we rotate, there is one topic being set up, then let’s have a conversation and learn from each other.” </span></p>

<h2><b>Establish a culture of accountability through leading by example</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“We actually don’t use email, what we do use is Slack. Every conversation within our company is on a Slack channel and all channels are open. It’s about </span><b>how we communicate with each other and hold each other accountable</b><span style="font-weight:400;">,” said Cindy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When “being accountable” means sharing and reflecting on your own work instead of punishment, it yields positive results in employee engagement and performance. “We have our quarterly goals, driven from the CEO, to see how we did on our goals and write a self-reflection report. The CEO starts it; he writes five points he did well and five points he did badly, and that is immediately posted on the Slack channel for everyone to see. And the CEO makes sure all of his reports do the same. If you admit to something you did wrong, </span><b>instead of sweeping it under the carpet, just admit it publicly and move on</b><span style="font-weight:400;">.” </span></p>
<h2><b>Build foundational skills into your culture </b></h2>
<p>Other characteristics of a great manager that came up included empathy and the ability to inspire others. But a big question raised was &#8211; are these traits things you can learn and develop, or do you have to come with it? Jennifer believes it is possible for people to improve upon talents they lack naturally.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">An approach to encouraging specific behaviors is to </span><b>build values into the organization</b><span style="font-weight:400;">. “One of the values at Nokia was empathy,” Jennifer said about her previous employer. “How great is that? If the company ensures you care about how people feel. One of the best thing you can do is </span><b>make values part of your culture explicitly</b><span style="font-weight:400;">.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Maintain a level of discomfort </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“The founder makes sure we always feel a little bit uncomfortable, because if we are too comfortable, we are not performing,” Cindy added. “He sets high expectations with lots of challenges along the way. The moment I feel like I accomplished something, there is the next.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“</span><b>Create a culture of authenticity, vulnerability and transparency</b><span style="font-weight:400;">; and enable managers to have human conversations, including the difficult ones,” said Jennifer. “With these ingredients, employees will be encouraged to take more risks, and the whole uncomfortable part is where growth happens.” </span></p>

<p>To close out 2016, we asked HR expert <a href="http://jasonlauritsen.com/">Jason Lauritsen</a> to contribute five posts spotlighting bad habits HR professionals should ditch. Let’s make it a 2017 resolution for HR departments.</p>
<p>Jason pulled no punches and spoke truth to an industry in a state of flux. In order for HR to establish its role within an organization, Jason suggests looking at other departments for innovation and rethinking how to approach classic HR situations.</p>
<p>If you have the time, we highly recommend <a href="https://blog.small-improvements.com/2016/11/29/the-2017-hr-hitlist-1-saying-no/">reading</a> <a href="https://blog.small-improvements.com/2016/12/06/the-hr-hitlist-2-enabling-bad-managers/">through</a> <a href="https://blog.small-improvements.com/2016/12/14/the-2017-hr-hitlist-3-defending-broken-practices/">each</a> <a href="https://blog.small-improvements.com/2016/12/20/the-2017-hr-hitlist-4-playing-small/">guest</a> <a href="https://blog.small-improvements.com/2016/12/27/the-2017-hr-hitlist-5-treating-technology-as-the-solution/">post</a> because those learnings will prove invaluable going into the new year.</p>
<p>For those in a time crunch, we summarized his work to highlight some particularly important points.<span id="more-4533"></span></p>
<h2><b>Stop Saying No<br />
</b></h2>
<p>Time management proponents preach the benefits of saying no. But Jason recommends that HR professionals get into the habit of saying yes. No matter how ridiculous the request, suppress the urge to respond with “no.”</p>
<p>Turns out that saying “I can help” instead and then challenging managers to explain the problem is more rewarding. This puts the onus on the manager to validate their ask, and thereby weeds out problems the managers could solve themselves.</p>
<p>This is a hack Jason learned from developers, who like HR also receive a lot of time-wasting requests. But instead of blocking, the Jason noticed how devs say yes and then put the ownership back on the manager to clarify what they’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>It sounds simple, but this approach can ensure HR is viewed more as an enabler, and less as an obstacle.</p>

<h2><b>Stop Enabling Bad Managers</b></h2>
<p>Ever get the feeling that your HR department is constantly putting out fires? Stop allowing poor managerial decisions to monopolize your department’s time and resources.</p>
<p>Jason summed this up perfectly when he compared HR to the Wolf in the popular film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/">Pulp Fiction</a>. The Wolf, played by Harvey Keitel, is called in to clean up a particularly bloody mess created by Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta’s characters, which he accomplishes with surprising expediency and skill.</p>
<p>HR should of course be capable of cleaning up the occasional mess, but managers also need to assume responsibility for their actions, instead of directing HR to fix the problem. HR professionals can change this tendency by <i>clearly</i> outlining their role to managers, and by coaching managers through problems with staff.</p>
<p>Cleaners make for cool characters in movies, but it’s stressful work in real life. Some problems are more easily solved through better communication.</p>

<h2><b>Stop Defending Broken Practices </b></h2>
<p>Forget the saying “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” In 2017, HR professionals need to take a critical look at all their practices and embrace a culture of innovation. Jason noted the antiquated way managers used to approach performance evaluations. Instead of calling it what it was, a broken process, managers would slog through them because that was the expectation.</p>
<p>We live in a constant state of change. If HR fails to adapt, the organization can suffer in the long term. An unresolved conflict can lead to unhappy employees, and unhappy employees can become former employees.</p>
<p>To develop a more innovative way of thinking, Jason recommends delving into the fields of psychology, brain science, sociology and behavioral economics. So in short: question everything, try new things, iterate, and don’t feel obligated to a process that doesn’t make sense.</p>

<h2><b>Stop Playing Small</b></h2>
<p>In his fourth blog for us, Jason touched on the topic of taking initiative and solidifying HR as leaders within the organization.</p>
<p>Far too long HR professionals have been viewed as behind-the-scenes administrators. So how do you position yourself as an expert?</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on collecting certifications, HR professional should focus their learning and development in two areas: becoming experts in human motivation and performance, and understanding the ins-and-outs of your company’s industry.</p>
<p>Here are two book recommendations from Jason to get you up to speed: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fierce-Conversations-Achieving-Success-Conversation/dp/0425193373/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484321456&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fierce+conversations">Fierce Conversations</a> by Susan Scott and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influencer-Science-Leading-Change-Second/dp/0071808868/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484321490&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=influencer+book">Influencer</a> by Grenny and Patterson.</p>
<p>Also, remember that nearly every decision within an organization affects the people working there. So speak up and be convincing, because it’s not enough for HR to be at the table if they’re not providing their expertise. Jason credited the sales training earlier in his career for giving him the ability to drive change and be an influencer within the organization.</p>

<h2><b>Stop Treating Technology As The Solution</b></h2>
<p><i>A tool is but an extension of a man’s hand, and a machine is but a complex tool &#8211; Henry Ward Beecher</i></p>
<p>In his final post of 2016, Jason suggested that technology is simply not the magic bullet HR professionals believe it to be.</p>
<p>To support his conclusion, Jason spoke to his belief that new, expensive golf clubs would cure his ailing golf game. But as anyone who’s tried their hand at golf knows, fancy clubs can’t solve the inherent problems in the golf swing.</p>
<p>An HR professional in 2017 needs to first understand the problem they want the technology to solve before identifying how the technology <i>should</i> be used. Finally ask yourself, how capable is the person using the technology? Simply put, a manager with poor interpersonal skills will struggle to have effective 1:1 meetings, no matter how comprehensive the software being used.</p>

Never before has the work of HR been so critical to organizational success. To meet this challenge requires that we break some old habits. This is the fifth in a series of guest posts from thought leader, </span></i><a href="http://jasonlauritsen.com/"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Jason Lauritsen</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight:400;">, called the 2017 HR Hitlist. Each of the five posts will outline one practice or behavior that HR needs to eliminate, and what they should do instead.</span></i></p>
<hr />
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Golf is a hard game. I’ve had a love/hate relationship with it throughout my life.&#8221;</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>There have been times when I’ve wanted to be good at golf. During one of these times, I became convinced that a buying a new, state of the art set of golf clubs was the solution. If I got better clubs, surely I’d play better.</p>
<p>So, I saved money and ultimately made the purchase. The clubs were spendy, but they were also beautiful. It felt good to show up at the golf course with these fancy clubs. Just owning them made me feel like a more confident golfer.</p>
<p>But when I played with them, I still sucked.</p>
<p>The new clubs didn’t fix my lack of skill. They also didn’t make up for lack of practice.</p>
<p>Golf clubs are tools. And regardless of how fancy or expensive, they are only as good as the hands that hold them.</p>
<h2>HR technology is just like those golf clubs.</h2>
<p>The explosion in technology innovation means that we have a virtually endless array of technology products to buy and implement within our organization. There are technologies for every problem you can imagine in HR—from employee engagement to new hire paperwork.<span id="more-4522"></span></p>
<p>And all of these cool technologies hold the promise of solving your most pressing HR problems.</p>
<p>But, just like my new golf clubs, buying technology could end up making you feel better at first, but it won’t solve the underlying issues. Technology is a tool. And unless it’s placed in the right hands, even the best tool can fail you.</p>
<p>If you are considering the purchase of a new system in 2017, or if you already have technology that’s failing to live up to your expectations, take a step back to assess if you’re doing the work required to make your investment a success.</p>
<p>Carefully consider the following three questions before making a purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you clear on the problem?</strong> My purchase of new golf clubs assumed that the quality of my tool was the problem, when in fact it was my lack of skill. New clubs made me look better, but didn’t fix my game. When considering a new technology, spend time clearly defining what problem(s) you are trying to solve. Investing in a goal management platform won’t help you create greater accountability if your real problem is a management team that is conflict-avoidant. Make sure you’re addressing the real issue.</li>
<li><strong>Is there a plan?</strong> Building a house requires a blueprint to ensure the tools are used in the right way. Do you have a blueprint for how your tools will be used? What are you trying to build? For example, if you’re purchasing a system for employee recognition, are you clear on why and what type of recognition is important to your employees? And, how will you know if your recognition efforts are making an impact?</li>
<li><strong>Are there skilled hands to use the tool?</strong> Implementing the best performance management technology in the world won’t compensate for a manager who can’t have a constructive conversation with an employee or who doesn’t know how to set goals. As you consider purchasing a system, define what knowledge and skills are required by the person using the tool. Feedback technology will be pretty ineffective if you don’t know how to give good feedback. Without skilled hands, a great tool can’t realize its potential impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>We live in remarkable times. There are so many amazing tools to aid our work in human resources. This technology can amplify and accelerate our efforts to create productive workplaces. But, we must always keep in mind that tools are not the solution. Tools require skilled hands and a plan.</p>

Never before has the work of HR been so critical to organizational success. To meet this challenge requires that we break some old habits. This is the fourth in a series of guest posts from thought leader, </span></i><a href="http://jasonlauritsen.com/"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Jason Lauritsen</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight:400;">, called the 2017 HR Hitlist. Each of the five posts will outline one practice or behavior that HR needs to eliminate, and what they should do instead. </span></i></p>
<hr />
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;If there’s one thing that’s holding us back in HR more than anything else, it is our collective lack of confidence.&#8221;</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Within every organization, we have departments built around technical expertise. IT are the experts in technology; finance and accounting in financial systems; and sales in sales process.  </span></p>
<p>We trust these departments to deliver solutions to business needs that exist within their areas. When the organization faces a technical challenge, we trust the IT team to assess the situation, understand the business needs, and find the right solution. Same for accounting and sales.</p>
<h2><strong>But, when it comes to HR, it’s a different story. Why is this? </strong></h2>
<p><span id="more-4505"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The first reason: When it comes to people problems, everyone feels like they should be involved and have a voice in the solution. Some of this is natural since the human systems are comprised of, well, humans who have their own experience about the systems that impact them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The second (and more problematic) reason is too many HR professionals shrink in the big moments. When it’s time to find some courage and take the lead, we defer the decision to others. Afterall, it’s safer to fail when everyone is involved in the decision, right? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This isn’t good enough, particularly when talent is </span><a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/people-organisation/publications/ceosurvey-talent-challenge.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">seen as a strategic challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> by our CEO’s. The HR leaders and departments of the future must rise to the occasion and elevate to the role of expert.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Here’s what that looks like:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Build and expand your expertise.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> I’m not talking about HR certifications here. We’ve got plenty of process expertise. What’s lacking is deep expertise in human motivation and performance. The HR team should have expertise in behavioral and brain science, adult learning theories, and leadership practice. HR should know as much about how humans are wired as IT does about networks and software.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Know your business.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> This goes far beyond products and services. It’s important to understand the customer and how your organization creates value for them. Get clear on what differentiates your offering from competitors, where your vulnerabilities lie, and how you make money. Then, connect the dots between that and how work gets done. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Speak up. </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Organizations exist because we depend upon people to do the work. Nearly every decision made has an implication for the people. HR should have a voice in shaping and communicating those decisions. And it’s not enough to just be at the table. HR must have an informed opinion based on our expertise. Keeping the human side of the business in the forefront is HR’s most important role. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Master the art of influence.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Here’s the sticking point: HR doesn’t control much of anything—it’s an influencer role. We can know the right solution, but unless we can get others to adopt it, it’s not of much value. Instead of being frustrated by this, HR must become masters of influence. </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fierce-Conversations-Achieving-Success-Conversation/dp/0425193373/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481545965&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fierce+conversations"><span style="font-weight:400;">Fierce Conversations</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> by Susan Scott and </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influencer-Science-Leading-Change-Second/dp/0071808868/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481545907&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=influencer"><span style="font-weight:400;">Influencer </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">by Grenny and Patterson are great places to start. Additionally, learn from sales. The fact that I started my career in sales and had the benefit of sales training allowed me to drive change as an HR leader with greater speed and effectiveness than my peers. The same will be true for you.  </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The role of HR today and in the future has changed, and it’s time to catch up. For too long, we’ve allowed ourselves to become relegated to the work of administration and policy enforcement. Our organizations need us to evolve and lead the way to creating workplaces where employees want to come and want to stay because they are finding growth and fulfillment.  </span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.small-improvements.com&#038;blog=32719928&#038;post=4505&#038;subd=smallimprove&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past year we’ve improved quite a few navigational elements: User and cycle search, upcoming admin dates, global create, and general speediness. More recently we&#8217;ve shifted our attention to the sidebar, and we&#8217;re proud to enter a public beta phase now.</p>
<p>The new navigation has been battle-tested internally by our own staff and select alpha clients, and we&#8217;re really pleased with it. But we won&#8217;t rush it. <strong>We plan on phasing out the &#8220;old&#8221; navigation by the end of Q1</strong>, so there&#8217;s plenty of time to take a look and give us feedback!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what is new and improved:</p>
<h2 id="BlogpostDraft:NewNavigationBeta-Dedicated">Dedicated &#8220;your content&#8221; section</h2>
<p>Until now the sidebar was split up strictly by module, showing submenus depending on the user&#8217;s role. An individual contributor would see their own review in the Performance Review menu, while a manager <em>also</em> saw their team&#8217;s reviews in an additional menu item.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re now dropping these role-specific menus, moving to a much cleaner and simpler layout: Independent of role every use immediately sees their <em>own</em> content – objectives, 360s, reviews &#8212; in one section:</p>

<h2 id="BlogpostDraft:NewNavigationBeta-New">New &#8220;Team&#8221; and &#8220;Company&#8221; sections</h2>
<p>All team- and company-wide content is now located in dedicated “Team” and “Company” pages. These new pages provide immediate insight into what <em>happened</em> in the person&#8217;s team and in the company by defaulting to an Activity tab. Both pages are available to <em>all</em> users. Inside these pages, the Activity and Objectives tabs are available to everyone, while additional tabs for reviews and 360s are displayed to managers and HR only. This makes it much easier for managers to think of their team as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="BlogpostDraft:NewNavigationBeta-Cleareraccesstocycles">Clearer access to cycles</h2>
<p>Once you select a tab for Reviews, 360s or Objectives, we&#8217;re now listing all cycles, rather than diving into the most recent one. This allows users to make a conscious decison <em>what</em> cycle to focus on. New or casual users will find the cycle overview approach much more natural to work with. Experienced SI Power users (who want to keep jumping straight into a cycle) can skip this new screen by using the &#8220;Jump to..&#8221; shortcut on the top-right of the screen.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2 id="BlogpostDraft:NewNavigationBeta-Objectivebrowserrepositioned">Objective browser repositioned</h2>
<p>The Objectives browser becomes far more prominent in the new navigation. When selecting the Objectives tab on either the Team or Company view, non-managers are shown the Objectives browser immediately. Managers and HR default to the cycle list, but can easily toggle the display to &#8220;Browse&#8221; mode at the top of the screen. This makes objectives of peers and managers much more visible than before, further strengthening our Objectives feature.</p>

<h2 id="BlogpostDraft:NewNavigationBeta-Nextsteps">Next steps</h2>
<p>To make it very clear, we&#8217;re not forcing this upon anyone, it&#8217;s every company&#8217;s decision when to test and when to enable the new navigation. We want every customer to be able to complete their current reviews, 360s or objectives cycle with no major change to the navigation.</p>
<p>We plan to making the &#8220;final&#8221; switch in late Q1, so there&#8217;s plenty of time to update any training material.</p>
<h2 id="BlogpostDraft:NewNavigationBeta-We'dlovetohearyourfeedback!">We&#8217;d love to hear your feedback!</h2>
<p>We’ve conducted plenty of in-depth user tests and we’re happily using the new navigation internally, and now we’d love to hear from you: Do you like the new approach? Are you keen to roll it out to your entire company? Or do you have concerns or reservations? Let us know your thoughts at <a class="external-link" href="mailto:product@small-improvements.com" rel="nofollow">product@small-improvements.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to test the new navigation using another (non-admin) user account? Send us a mail and we&#8217;ll enable it for them too.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.small-improvements.com&#038;blog=32719928&#038;post=4389&#038;subd=smallimprove&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Never before has the work of HR been so critical to organizational success. To meet this challenge requires that we break some old habits. This is the third in a series of guest posts from thought leader, <a href="http://jasonlauritsen.com/"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Jason Lauritsen</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight:400;">, called the 2017 HR Hitlist. Each of the five posts will outline one practice or behavior that HR needs to eliminate, and what they should do instead.</span></i><br />
</span></i></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When I </span><a href="https://www.eremedia.com/tlnt/talent-management-insanity-or-why-the-performance-appraisal-must-die/"><span style="font-weight:400;">first started railing</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> against the performance appraisal process years ago, my colleagues in HR were the first to defend it.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">“We have to do appraisals to protect ourselves legally.” </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">“We can’t make fair decisions about pay increases without an appraisal.” </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">“We have to have some record of performance.”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">“You can’t assess performance without ratings.” </span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The ironic thing was that many of these same colleagues actually despised the very process they were defending. It was cumbersome, time consuming, and they knew the information contained in the appraisals was questionable in far too many cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">While defending it, they had to ignore the truth that </span><a href="http://www.ioatwork.com/performance-appraisals-and-how-they-go-wrong/"><span style="font-weight:400;">performance appraisals are often inflated</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> by managers looking to avoid conflict. Plus, they had been telling managers that appraisals were a legal requirement for so long, they’d forgotten that it’s </span><a href="http://www.dwt.com/files/Publication/f2cfee57-e5f7-4ac2-8ed4-e3062d777d79/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/b62f392c-2835-4933-ac5e-e46440b2eb5d/pubs_Keyes_HRMag%20April%202011.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">not actually true</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The process was broken and they knew it. But, they defended it because they felt like they had to.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There can be no innovation or progress unless we’re open to the possibility of a better way. The black or white, yes or no, approach to HR does not work in a world of perpetual and accelerating change. As a consequence, HR is riddled with ineffective, old management practices born in an </span><a href="http://www.strategicleadershipinstitute.net/news/the-historical-evolution-of-management-theory-from-1900-to-present-the-changing-role-of-leaders-in-organizations-/"><span style="font-weight:400;">age of industrialization</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that have no place in today’s world of work.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">While it seems that perhaps we’ve </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-accenture-deloitte-got-rid-performance-reviews-you-bernard-marr"><span style="font-weight:400;">made progress towards replacing the traditional performance appraisal process</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, that’s only the beginning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">How should interviewing and selection change due to the fact that </span><a href="https://www.recruiter.com/i/4-types-of-interviewer-bias-and-how-to-eliminate-them/"><span style="font-weight:400;">people are really bad at evaluating other people</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">? Or, what happens to compensation when we consider the evidence that financial bonuses are </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc"><span style="font-weight:400;">negatively correlated</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> with performance for complex and creative work?  </span><span id="more-4427"></span></p>
<h2><strong>We must stop defending and protecting “best practices” in HR. Instead, we need to adopt a mindset of innovation and progress. Here are some steps for how to get started.</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Don’t be defensive—be curious.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> When customers hate a product feature, the creator of that product figures out why and makes changes. If they don’t, they are sunk. We need to think about HR in the same way. If the customers (employees and managers) hate a process, defending it only makes things worse. Instead, we should be asking questions to understand what’s not working and strive to fix it. Our goal in HR should be to facilitate a work experience that’s engaging and productive. If our processes are getting in the way of that, they need to change.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Know why and measure. </b><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the most powerful questions you can ask of any HR practice or process is this: What does success look like? And once you know the answer, how will you measure success? Take for example the employee handbook. Almost every organization has one. And most are rarely (if ever) read by employees. What does success look like for the employee handbook? If HR is honest, success is simply having one that’s updated (check that box). Not a satisfying or productive answer. That might lead to better questions like, “Why do we need an employee handbook?” and, “What are we trying to accomplish for employees with this handbook?” This is where progress begins. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Check the science. </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Human resources is first and foremost about the humans. And there are expansive fields of study that provide scientific insights about how humans tick and what motivates us. When it’s time to design HR processes or employee experiences, instead of turning to outdated practices (e.g. performance appraisals), look first to the fields of </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">psychology</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="https://neuroleadership.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">brain science</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="http://www.everydaysociologyblog.com/2011/11/the-sociology-of-work.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">sociology </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpMLYh-UIsA"><span style="font-weight:400;">behavioral economics</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for insight into how to design in a way that’s good for the humans involved.    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Try new things. </b><span style="font-weight:400;">To really move HR forward in your organization, create opportunities to experiment. Have an idea for a new way to provide performance feedback? Find a manager who is open to trying new things and invite them to test it and measure the results. Early in my HR career, one of my mentors, </span><a href="http://www.realitybasedleadership.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Cy Wakeman</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, taught me to “work with the willing.” In other words, find colleagues who are committed to people and spend time giving them support and new ideas. When you find success, share the story as a way to create buy-in. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">HR must break free from the shackles of “best practice.” Too much of what was handed down from the past is no longer relevant today. We must innovate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This starts with shedding our defensiveness and being more open to hearing the voices of those on the other side of our processes and practices. When our processes don’t feel productive or helpful to those whom they’re designed to support, it’s time to make change. </span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.small-improvements.com&#038;blog=32719928&#038;post=4427&#038;subd=smallimprove&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Never before has the work of HR been so critical to organizational success. To meet this challenge requires that we break some old habits. This is the second in a series of guest posts from thought leader, <a href="http://jasonlauritsen.com/" target="_blank">Jason Lauritsen</a>, called the 2017 HR Hitlist. Each of the five posts will outline one practice or behavior that HR needs to eliminate, and what they should do instead. </span></i></p>
<hr />
<blockquote><p><strong><em>One of my favorite movies is the classic Quentin Tarantino film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/" target="_blank">Pulp Fiction</a>.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There’s a character in the movie who they refer to as “The Wolf.” He’s a fixer. When someone screws up or makes a serious mess, they call The Wolf. He shows up to save the day by making the problem disappear.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I think this is how management often thinks of HR—as their own personal version of “The Wolf.” When an uncomfortable conversation is needed or they’ve made a mess with an employee, they call HR. And, since we love to feel needed in HR, we swoop in and handle things. The manager’s problem disappears. Everybody wins, right?</span><span id="more-4334"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Wrong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Here’s the problem: “The Wolf” in Pulp Fiction is not a good guy. In fact, he’s a very bad guy who helps other bad guys cover up the bad things they’ve done. He’s an </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">enabler</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> of really bad behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When HR swoops in like The Wolf to take over for a manager in uncomfortable conversations, we enable bad behavior. When we help them cover up that they aren’t managing their employees’ performance diligently, we enable bad behavior.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When managers don’t feel the consequences of their behavior, there’s no fuel for change. Bad managers continue practicing bad management, HR continues trying to fix it, and employees continue paying the price.  </span></p>
<h2><strong>It’s time to stop enabling bad managers. </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We need to own that despite our best intentions, we are part of the problem in HR. We need to stop trying to fix the situation and start coaching the manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the most important roles that HR should play is to ensure the organization has good people management practices. This may require a shift in your thinking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Here is what it looks like to fulfill this role.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Clearly outline the role of the manager.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> This is an often overlooked, yet critically important step. By clearly articulating expectations and the associated accountabilities in detail, you create great clarity for the manager. Reinforce that they are the primary source of communication, feedback and encouragement for the employee. This means they are responsible for both the fun and the not-so-fun parts of the job. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Clearly outline the role of HR in supporting managers. </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Part of the challenge for HR is that managers aren’t always clear about human resources’ role. Being explicit about what you will and </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">won’t </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">do up front limits the number of “fix it” requests you receive and makes it easier to push back when you do.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Coach, don’t fix.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> When a manager asks you to do their job for them, don’t enable them by saying yes. Instead, remind them that it’s their job to coach employees. Start with this: “Tell me how you’d approach the conversation.” Provide them with ideas and suggestions to prepare them for success. Then, make a commitment to follow up after the conversation so you can coach some more. Ask what went well and what they’d do differently next time. Soon, they’ll develop the skills they need so they won’t need to call you in the first place. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><b>Let them clean up their own messes. </b><span style="font-weight:400;">The pain of consequences is a powerful </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-prime/201201/personal-growth-motivation-the-drive-change"><span style="font-weight:400;">motivator for change</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. HR should not try to remove this pain. When a manager fails to confront a performance problem with an employee for months, then suddenly wants to fire that employee, there should be some consequences for that manager. Because despite their desire to fire, they likely need to spend time working with the employee and giving them an opportunity to turn things around. It may also be valuable to involve the manager’s manager to ensure the issue is taken seriously. Once managers learn that you aren’t going to bail them out, they will be more likely to do their job and avoid the consequences of not doing so.  </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s often said that employees join organizations, but they leave managers. If we are to win the war for talent, we must stop enabling and start coaching for better managers today.  </span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.small-improvements.com&#038;blog=32719928&#038;post=4334&#038;subd=smallimprove&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="Blogpostdraft:RequestFeedback-NewinSmallImprovements:Requestfeedbackanytime(BETA)">Imagine you just finished a project, or you’ve been working with a new skill. You’re curious as to how you did and want some feedback from your peers. But how do you go about getting it?</p>
<div>You might email your colleagues or ask them in person &#8211; both approaches have their place, but both lack structure. On top of this, it will be difficult to refer back to your feedback at a later date.</div>
<div></div>
<p>With this in mind, we’re excited to introduce our new Request Feedback feature &#8211; a big step towards better helping your employees take ownership of their performance and make continuous improvements. This update allows every employee in your company to request feedback from whomever they want, whenever they want. Not only have we shortened the feedback cycle, but your employees can request feedback as they see fit.</p>
<h2 id="Blogpostdraft:RequestFeedback-RequestFeedbackinpractice">Request Feedback in practice</h2>
<div>Let’s say you just organized an event for your company, and want to get some feedback on what your peers thought of it, and how you can improve the next event.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Head over to your dashboard and click on the <strong>+Create</strong> button in the top right corner. You can read all about the functionalities of this new button <a class="external-link" href="https://blog.small-improvements.com/2016/11/28/two-small-ui-improvement-to-spice-up-the-navigation/" rel="nofollow">on this blogpost</a>.

<p><span id="more-4346"></span>With our flexible options, you can decide who you want reviews from &#8211; whether it’s your manager or your best friend in the company who you can always count on for constructive feedback. You can also ask the questions you care about the most. Questions you believe can help you better understand how to enhance future performance. And the best part is, you can keep your reviews private. We created this feature to help employees drive their own feedback cycles and be in charge of their own personal development.</p>
<p>Once a Feedback Request is created, simply sit back and wait for your feedback. The next steps are simple: your chosen reviewers will automatically receive an email invitation with the details of the request and a direct link to provide input. Reviewers will also find the request to give feedback in their dashboard.</p>

<p>Once reviewers provide their feedback and click share, you will receive the input you requested in real time, or on your indicated date. Voilà! Now you can leverage the feedback to better understand how to improve your performance in the future.</p>
<p>Feedback is a personal thing, and employees want to know how they’re performing. Our Request Feedback feature enables employees to kickstart their own 360 degree feedback as they see fit, without needing HR to define the cycle or the prior approval of management. This ensures no employee is overlooked for feedback when they want it and allows for spontaneous touch points with peers. Being able to personalize their own feedback will also allow employees to leverage the most out of peer input to enhance future performance.</p>
<p>But enough of us talking, check out the new feature for yourself!</p>
